# Shell Project

```
$ foo="bar"
$ echo $foo
bar
$ echo $fool

```
This is because the shell happily created the variable fool when it encountered it, and gave it the default value of nothing, or empty.

## A sample HTML page using shell

```
#!/bin/bash
# Program to output a system information page
TITLE="System Information Report For $HOSTNAME"
echo "<HTML>
	<HEAD>
	</HEAD>
	<BODY>
	<TITLE>$TITLE</TITLE>
	<H1>$TITLE</H1>
	</BODY>
</HTML>"
```

```
$ bash sample_html.sh > sample.html
$ firefox sample.html
```

Note that in an assignment, there must be no spaces between the variable name, the equals sign, and the value. So what can the value consist of? Anything that we can expand into a string:
```
a=z
b="a string"
c="a string and $b"
d=$(ls -l foo.txt)
e=$((5 * 7))
f="\t\ta string\n"
# Assign the string "z" to variable a.
# Embedded spaces must be within quotes.
# Other expansions such as variables can be
# expanded into the assignment.
# Results of a command.
# Arithmetic expansion.
# Escape sequences such as tabs and newlines.
```
Multiple variable assignments may be done on a single line:
```
a=5 b="a string"
```

Here, we try to change the name of a file from `myfile` to `myfile1`, using a variable:

```
$ filename="myfile"
$ touch $filename
$ mv $filename $filename1
mv: missing destination file operand after `myfile'
Try `mv --help' for more information
```
Do it this way
```
$ mv $filename ${filename}1
```
By adding the surrounding braces, the shell no longer interprets the trailing 1 as part of the variable name.

See the use of date
```
$ date +"%x %r %Z"
```

```
#!/bin/bash
# Program to output a system information page
TITLE="System Information Report For $HOSTNAME"
CURRENT_TIME=$(date +"%x %r %Z")
TIMESTAMP="Generated $CURRENT_TIME, by $USER"
echo "<HTML>
	<HEAD>
	<TITLE>$TITLE</TITLE>
	</HEAD>
	<BODY>
	<H1>$TITLE</H1>
	<P>$TIMESTAMP</P>
	</BODY>
</HTML>"
```
```
<HTML>
        <HEAD>
        <TITLE>System Information Report For workstation</TITLE>
        </HEAD>
        <BODY>
        <H1>System Information Report For workstation</H1>
        <P>Generated 10/20/2022 02:54:12 AM IST, by himanshu</P>
        </BODY>
</HTML>
```

Another way to feed data to a command: here document

where command is the name of command that accepts standard input and token is a string used to indicate the end of the embedded text.
```
command << token
text
token
```

Then use this method instead of echo to make a file in script.
```
#!/bin/bash
# Program to output a system information page
TITLE="System Information Report For $HOSTNAME"
CURRENT_TIME=$(date +"%x %r %Z")
TIMESTAMP="Generated $CURRENT_TIME, by $USER"
cat << _EOF_
<HTML>
	<HEAD>
	</HEAD>
	<BODY>
	<TITLE>$TITLE</TITLE>
	<H1>$TITLE</H1>
	<P>$TIMESTAMP</P>
	</BODY>
</HTML>
_EOF_
```
