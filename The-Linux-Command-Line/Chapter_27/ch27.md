# Flow Control

```bash
#!/bin/bash

val=5					# = should not have space around it
if [ $val -eq 5 ]; then	# single space around and inside [ ]  are mandatory
	echo "It is 5"
else
	echo "It is not 5"
fi

# It is 5
```
When can do the same on command line like this
```bash
$ x=5
$ if [ $x -eq 5 ]; then echo "It is 5"; else echo "It is not 5"; fi
It is 5
```

The actual syntax is
```
if commands; then
commands
[elif commands; then
commands...]
[else
commands]
fi
```

Commands (including the scripts and shell functions we write) issue a value to the system when they terminate, called an exit status. This value, which is an integer in the range of 0 to 255, indicates the success or failure of the commandâ€™s execution. By convention, a
value of zero indicates success and any other value indicates failure.

```
$ ls 
ch27.md  sample.sh
$ echo $?
0
$ ls /bin/usrRandom?
ls: cannot access '/bin/usrRandom?': No such file or directory
$ echo $?
2
```
The shell provides two extremely simple builtin commands that do nothing except terminate with either a zero or one exit status.
```
$ true
$ echo $?
0
$ false
$ echo $?
1
```

## Test
```
test expression
```
and the more popular:
```
[ expression ]
```
where expression is an expression that is evaluated as either true or false.

## File Expressions

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-file: Evaluate the status of a file
FILE=~/.bashrc

if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then
	if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
		echo "$FILE is a regular file."
	fi
	if [ -d "$FILE" ]; then
		echo "$FILE is a directory."
	fi
	if [ -r "$FILE" ]; then
		echo "$FILE is readable."
	fi
	if [ -w "$FILE" ]; then
		echo "$FILE is writable."
	fi
	if [ -x "$FILE" ]; then
		echo "$FILE is executable/searchable."
	fi
else
	echo "$FILE does not exist"
	exit 1
fi
exit

# /home/himanshu/.bashrc is a regular file.
# /home/himanshu/.bashrc is readable.
# /home/himanshu/.bashrc is writable.
```

| Experssion | Is True if |
| --- | --- |
| `file1 -ef file2` | file1 and file2 have the same inode numbers |
| `file1 -nt file2` | file1 is newer than file2 |
| `file1 -ot file2` | file1 is older than file2 |
| `-e file` | file exists |
| `-d file` | file exists and is a directory |
|`-f file` | file exists and is a regular file |
| `-L file` | file exists and is a symbolic link|
| `-s file` | file exists and has a length greater than zero |

## String Expressions

| Expression | Is True if |
| ---	|	--- |
| `string` | string is not null |
| `-n string` | The length of string is greater than zero |
| `-z string` | The length of string is zero |
| `string1 = string2` or `string1 == string2` | string1 and string2 are equal. Single or double equal signs may be used, but the use of double equal signs is greatly preferred |
| `string1 != string2` | string1 and string2 are not equal |
| `string1 > string2` | string1 sorts after string2 |
| `string1 < string2` | string1 sorts before string2 |

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-string: evaluate the value of a string
ANSWER=maybe

if [ -z "$ANSWER" ]; then
	echo "There is no answer." >&2
	exit 1
fi

if [ "$ANSWER" = "yes" ]; then
	echo "The answer is YES."
elif [ "$ANSWER" = "no" ]; then
	echo "The answer is NO."
elif [ "$ANSWER" = "maybe" ]; then
	echo "The answer is MAYBE."
else
	echo "The answer is UNKNOWN."
fi

# The answer is MAYBE.
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-string: evaluate the value of a string
ANSWER=maybe

if [ -z "$ANSWER" ]; then
	echo "There is no answer." >&2
	exit 1
fi

if [ "$ANSWER" = "yes" ]; then
	echo "The answer is YES."
elif [ "$ANSWER" = "no" ]; then
	echo "The answer is NO."
elif [ "$ANSWER" = "maybe" ]; then
	echo "The answer is MAYBE."
else
	echo "The answer is UNKNOWN."
fi

# The answer is MAYBE.
```

## Integer Expressions

| Expression | Is True If |
| --- | --- |
| `integer1 -eq integer2` | integer1 is equal to integer2 |
| `integer1 -ne integer2` | integer1 is not equal to integer2 |
| `integer1 -le integer2` | integer1 is less than or equal to integer2 |
| `integer1 -lt integer2` | integer1 is less than integer2 |
| `integer1 -ge integer2` | integer1 is greater than or equal to integer2 |
| `integer1 -gt integer2` | integer1 is greater than integer2 |

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-integer: evaluate the value of an integer.
INT=-5
if [ -z "$INT" ]; then
	echo "INT is empty." >&2
	exit 1
fi

if [ $INT -eq 0 ]; then
	echo "INT is zero."
else
	if [ $INT -lt 0 ]; then
		echo "INT is negative."
	else
		echo "INT is positive."
	fi

	if [ $((INT % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
		echo "INT is even."
	else
		echo "INT is odd."
	fi
fi

# INT is negative.
# INT is odd.
```

## Modern Version Of test

Recent versions of bash include modern version of test.
```
[[ expression ]]
```
The `[[ ]]` command is very similar to test (it supports all of its expressions), but adds an important new string expression:
```
string1 =~ regex
```
which returns true if `string1` is matched by the extended regular expression `regex`.

Now we can check the previous script integer for a integer value in better way and not just based on string size.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-integer2: evaluate the value of an integer.
INT=-5

if [[ "$INT" =~ ^-?[0-9]+$ ]]; then
	if [ $INT -eq 0 ]; then
		echo "INT is zero."
	else
		if [ $INT -lt 0 ]; then
			echo "INT is negative."
		else
			echo "INT is positive."
		fi
		
		if [ $((INT % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
			echo "INT is even."
		else
			echo "INT is odd."
		fi
	fi
else
	echo "INT is not an integer." >&2
	exit 1
fi

# INT is negative
# INT is odd
```

Another added feature of `[[ ]]` is that the `==` operator supports pattern matching the same way pathname expansion does.
```
$ FILE=foo.bar
$ if [[ $FILE == foo.* ]]; then
> echo "$FILE matches pattern 'foo.*'"
> fi
foo.bar matches pattern 'foo.*'
```

## (( )) - Designed For Integers
`(( ))` is used to perform arithmetic truth tests.

```
$ if ((1)); then echo "True"; fi
True
$ if ((0)); then echo "True"; fi
```

You can use them as 
```
$ echo $(( 5%2 ))
1
$ echo $(( 5%3 ))
2
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
INT=-5

if [[ "$INT" =~ ^-?[0-9]+$ ]]; then
	if ((INT == 0)); then
		echo "INT is zero."
	else
		if ((INT < 0)); then
			echo "INT is negative."
		else
			echo "INT is positive."
		fi
	
		if (( ((INT % 2)) == 0 )); then
			echo "INT is even."
		else
			echo "INT is odd."
		fi
	fi
else
	echo "INT is not an integer." >&2
	exit 1
fi

# INT is negative.
# INT is odd.
```

## Logical Operators

| Operation | test | [[ ]] and (( ))
| --- | --- | --- |
| AND | `-a` | `&&`
| OR | `-o` | `||`
| NOT | `!` | `!`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
MIN_VAL=1
MAX_VAL=100
INT=500

if [[ "$INT" =~ ^-?[0-9]+$ ]]; then
	if [[ INT -ge MIN_VAL && INT -le MAX_VAL ]]; then
		echo "$INT is within $MIN_VAL to $MAX_VAL."
	elif [[ ! ( INT -ge MIN_VAL && INT -le MAX_VAL ) ]]; then
		echo "$INT is out of range."
	else
		echo "This is not possible"
	fi
else
	echo "INT is not an integer." >&2
	exit 1
fi
```

```
$ [ -d temp ] || mkdir temp
```
Will test for the existence of the directory temp, and only if the test fails, will the directory be created.
```
[ -d temp ] || exit 1
```
If the script requires the directory temp, and it does not exist, then the script will terminate with an exit status of one.
