# Package Management

Package management is a method of installing and maintaining software on the system.  
Most distributions fall into one of two camps of packaging technologies: the Debian `.deb` camp and the Red Hat `.rpm` camp.

| Packaging System  | Distributions (Partial Listing)  			|
|	-----------		|				---							|
|  Debian Style  	|  (.deb)Debian, Ubuntu, Xandros, Linspire  |
|  Red Hat Style  	|  (.rpm)Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OpenSUSE, Mandriva, PCLinuxOS  |


## Package Files
The basic unit of software in a packaging system is the package file. A package file is a compressed collection of files that comprise the software package.

Package files are created by a person known as a package maintainer, often (but not always) an employee of the distribution vendor. The package maintainer gets the software in source code form from the upstream provider (the author of the program), compiles it, and creates the package metadata and any necessary installation scripts. Often, the package maintainer will apply modifications to the original source code to improve the program's integration with the other parts of the Linux distribution.

## Finding A Package In A Repository

|	Style  	|	Command	|
| 	--- 	|	---		|
|	Debian	|  `apt-get update; apt-cache search search_string`  |
|	Red Hat	|  `yum search search_string`  |

```bash
himanshu@workstation:~$ apt-cache search "vim" "Enhanced" "Vi" "Improved"
vim - Vi IMproved - enhanced vi editor
vim-tiny - Vi IMproved - enhanced vi editor - compact version
vim-athena - Vi IMproved - enhanced vi editor - with Athena GUI
vim-gtk - Vi IMproved - enhanced vi editor (dummy package)
vim-gtk3 - Vi IMproved - enhanced vi editor - with GTK3 GUI
vim-nox - Vi IMproved - enhanced vi editor - with scripting languages support
```

## Installing A Package From A Repository

|	Style  	|	Command	|
| 	--- 	|	---		|
|	Debian	|  `apt-get update; apt-get install package_name`  |
|	Red Hat	|  `yum search search_string`  |

## Installing A Package From A Package File

|	Style  	|	Command	|
| 	--- 	|	---		|
|	Debian	|  `dpkg --install package_file`  |
|	Red Hat	|  `rpm -i package_file`  |

Since this technique uses the low-level rpm program to perform the installation, no dependency resolution is performed. If rpm discovers a missing dependency, rpm will exit with an error.

## Removing A Package

|	Style  	|	Command	|
| 	--- 	|	---		|
|	Debian	|  `apt-get remove package_name`  |
|	Red Hat	|  `yum erase package_name`  |

## Updating Packages From A Repository

|	Style  	|	Command	|
| 	--- 	|	---		|
|	Debian	|  `apt-get update; apt-get upgrade`  |
|	Red Hat	|  `yum update`  |

## Upgrading A Package From A Package File
If an updated version of a package has been downloaded from a non-repository source, it can be installed, replacing the previous version.

|	Style  	|	Command	|
| 	--- 	|	---		|
|	Debian	|  `dpkg --install package_file`  |
|	Red Hat	|  `rpm -U package_file`  |

dpkg does not have a specific option for upgrading a package versus installing one as rpm does.

## Listing Installed Packages

|	Style  	|	Command	|
| 	--- 	|	---		|
|	Debian	|  `dpkg --list`  |
|	Red Hat	|  `rpm -qa`  |

## Determining If A Package Is Installed

|	Style  	|	Command	|
| 	--- 	|	---		|
|	Debian	|  `dpkg --status package_name`  |
|	Red Hat	|  `rpm -q package_name`  |

## Displaying Info About An Installed Package

|	Style  	|	Command	|
| 	--- 	|	---		|
|	Debian	|  `apt-cache show package_name`  |
|	Red Hat	|  `yum info package_name`  |

## Finding Which Package Installed A File

|	Style  	|	Command	|
| 	--- 	|	---		|
|	Debian	|  `dpkg --search file_name`  |
|	Red Hat	|  `rpm -qf file_name`  |

Example: To see what package installed the /usr/bin/vim file on a Red Hat system:
```
rpm -qf /usr/bin/vim
```
