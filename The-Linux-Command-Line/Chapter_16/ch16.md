# Networking

- `ping` - Send an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts
- `traceroute` - Print the route packets trace to a network host
- `netstat` - Print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships
- `ftp` - Internet file transfer program
- `wget` - Non-interactive network downloader
- `ssh` - OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)

## ping
The ping command sends a special network packet called an IMCP ECHO_REQUEST to a specified host. Most network devices receiving this packet will reply to it, allowing the network connection to be verified.

Note: It is possible to configure most network devices (including Linux hosts) to ignore these packets. This is usually done for security reasons, to partially obscure a host from a potential attacker. It is also common for firewalls to be configured to block IMCP traffic.

## traceroute
The traceroute program displays a listing of all the “hops” network traffic takes to get from the local system to a specified host.

We have to hop 14 routers

For routers that provided identifying information, we see their hostnames, IP addresses, and performance data, which includes three samples of round-trip time from the local system to the router. For routers that do not provide identifying information (because of router configuration, network congestion, firewalls, etc.)

- `eth0` is the Ethernet interface.
- `lo`, is the loopback interface, a virtual interface that the system uses to “talk to itself.”

When performing causal network diagnostics, the important things to look for are the presence of the word “UP” at the fourth column in first line for each interface, indicating that the network interface is enabled.

Using the “-r” option will display the kernel’s network routing table.

## Transporting Files Over A Network

### ftp
Name drived from underlying protocol File Transfer Protocol.  
Before there were web browsers, there was the ftp program. ftp is used to communicate with FTP servers, machines that contain files that can be uploaded and downloaded over a network.

FTP (in its original form) is not secure, because it sends account names and passwords in cleartext. This means that they are not encrypted and anyone sniffing the network can see them. Because of this, almost all FTP done over the Internet is done by anonymous FTP servers. An anonymous server allows anyone to login using the login name “anonymous” and a meaningless password.

### lftp – A Better ftp
ftp is not the only command-line FTP client. In fact, there are many. One of the better (and more popular) ones is `lftp` by Alexander Lukyanov. It works much like the traditional ftp program, but has many additional convenience features including multiple protocol support (including HTTP), automatic re-try on failed downloads, background processes, tab completion of path names, and many more.

## wget
Another popular command-line program for file downloading is wget. It is useful for downloading content from both web and FTP sites. Single files, multiple files, and even entire sites can be downloaded.

```

## Secure Communication With Remote Hosts
Some old tools for this was `rlogin` and `telnet` programs. These programs, however, suffer from the same fatal flaw that the `ftp` program does; they transmit all their communications (including login
names and passwords) in cleartext.

`ssh` to address this problem, a new protocol called SSH (Secure Shell) was developed.

First, it authenticates that the remote host is who it says it is (thus preventing so-called “man in the
middle” attacks), and second, it encrypts all of the communications between the local and remote hosts.

SSH consists of two parts. An SSH server runs on the remote host, listening for incoming connections on port 22, while an SSH client is used on the local system to communicate with the remote server.

Most Linux distributions ship an implementation of SSH called OpenSSH from the OpenBSD project. Some distributions include both the client and the server packages by default (for example, Red Hat), while others (such as Ubuntu) only supply the client. To enable a system to receive remote connections, it must have the OpenSSH-server package installed, configured and running, and (if the system is either running or is behind a firewall) it must allow incoming network connections on TCP port 22.

Check if you have ssh client already or not 
```
$ dpkg --list | grep ssh-client
ii  openssh-client     
```
If not then install client as 
```
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-client
```

Check the host to which we want to connect have ssh server. Run below command on target host.
```
$ ssh localhost	
ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused username@host
```
Then you need to install ssh server as
```
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
```
Then try again

```
$ ssh localhost
The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:LC/sOf90k1B1qNjlpEOtIdxchFGmCFYEs9Rpny1FALc.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'localhost' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
himanshu@localhost's password: 

$ exit
logout
Connection to localhost closed.
```

If the local user “me” had an account named “bob” on a remote system, user `me` could log in to the account `bob` on the remote system as follows:
```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ ssh bob@remote-sys
bob@remote-sys's password:
Last login: Sat Aug 30 13:03:21 2008
[bob@remote-sys ~]$
```

Besides opening a shell session on a remote system, ssh also allows us to execute a single command on a remote system. For example, to execute the free command on a remote host named remote-sys and have the results displayed on the local system:
```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ ssh remote-sys free
me@twin4's password:
total	used	free	Mem:
...
```
OR
```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ ssh remote-sys 'ls *' > dirlist.txt
me@twin4's password:
[me@linuxbox ~]$
```
Notice the use of the single quotes in the command above. This is done because we do not want the pathname expansion performed on the local machine; rather, we want it to be performed on the remote system.

## scp And sftp
The OpenSSH package also includes two programs that can make use of an SSH-en-
crypted tunnel to copy files across the network. 
- scp (secure copy)
- sftp (secure ftp)

But source or destination pathnames may be preceded with the name of a remote host, followed by a colon character.   
For example, if we wanted to copy a document named `document.txt` from our home directory on the remote system, `remote-sys`, to the current working directory on our local system, we could do this:
```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ scp remote-sys:document.txt .
me@remote-sys's password:
document.txt			100% 5581
[me@linuxbox ~]$
```

As with ssh, you may apply a username to the beginning of the remote host’s name if the desired remote host account name does not match that of the local system:
```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ scp bob@remote-sys:document.txt .
```

`sftp` works much like the original `ftp` program that we used earlier; however, instead of transmitting everything in cleartext, it uses an SSH encrypted tunnel. sftp has an important advantage over conventional ftp in that it does not require an FTP server to be running on the remote host. It only requires the SSH server. This means that any remote machine that can connect with the SSH client can also
be used as a FTP-like server.
